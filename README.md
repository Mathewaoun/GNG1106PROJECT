#GNG1106PROJECT (Mathew Aoun & Elias Tarabey)
The problem that we are trying to resolve is determining the appropriate value of the inductance
L for a specific inductor so that it could be conformed to the desired rate of dissipation td of the
RLC circuit. This determination will be based on a given resistor (R), capacitor (C) and time
dissipation values. It is also important to mention that the rate of dissipation must be depended
on by an upper and lower bound limit of a desired percentage of charge (pc) for the capacitor to
reach regarding its original charge.
The program that will be written to solve the problem will take in inputs of capacitance,
resistance and time dissipation from the user, and these values will be processed through
equations given in the prompt document (Equations 9 and 10 could be used to find the value of
the inductance based off of user inputs, as well as Equation 7, which would be used to determine
the charge that the capacitor would be at based on the time dissipation. This could be used to
verify if the value of L would be conformed to the time dissipation given by the user.) After
verifying the validity of the values of L, the results could then be graphed, and the values could
be saved in a file.
